\subsection{Link to existing research}
    \comment{Compare with other LWTA on MNIST and Cifar10 \Carl}
    \comment{Maybe include discussion on ML as a tool in neurobiological research \Anna} 


\subsection{Overfitting}
    \comment{I thought it would be fitting (haha) with a separate discussion on overfitting and the various ways in which we have combatted it here. -\Carl}


\subsubsection{Interpretation of pathways}
    \comment{\Anna or \Carl}

\subsubsection{Only 49 hyperparameter points explored}
    Our motivation was not to explore all of the hyperparameter space, but rather explore some structures in the high performing models. (eg. structures: MO vs CO vs Dense, and how many layer)

\subsubsection{PCA - did not choose the PCA-features}
