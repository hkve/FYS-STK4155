Discussion here, in present/past tense.


\subsection{Link to existing research}
    \comment{Compare with other LWTA on MNIST and Cifar10 \Carl}
    \comment{Maybe include discussion on ML as a tool in neurobiological research \Anna} 


\subsection{Overfitting}
    \comment{I thought it would be fitting (haha) with a separate discussion on overfitting and the various ways in which we have combatted it here. -\Carl}


\subsubsection{Interpretation of pathways}
    \comment{\Anna or \Carl}

\subsubsection{Only 49 hyperparameter points explored}
    Our motivation was not to explore all of the hyperparameter space, but rather explore some structures in the high performing models. (eg. structures: MO vs CO vs Dense, and how many layer)
    \comment{\Carl or \Anna} \\
    \comment{On CIFAR-10: $27+12+6+4 = 49$} \\
    \comment{On EPL: $3 \times (81 + 34 + 15 + 8 + 5) = 3 \times 143 = 429$}

\subsubsection{PCA - did not choose the PCA-features}

\subsubsection{Explainability of MO/CO}
    \comment{Can features be recognised in the pathways? NB! Features human notice are not necessarily the same as the ones a machine notice -\Anna}
